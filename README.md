### Default incompatibility with modded respawn points

Due to there being no reliable way to get the players respawn point, a block check is preformed but due to this block check, blocks need to be manually added to a list of valid respawn points in the config.

## Requirements

* Starting in version 0.2 owo lib is required for configs to work.
* Mod is serverside ONLY and will not run clientside
